"God damn this stupid-" I let out a string of swears as my weapon malfunctions. I swept my fringe aside as it fell in front of my
eyes once again. 
I gave a satisfied smile as I finally fixed my weapon. 
"Hey, girl, go somewhere else." A voice grunted behind me. 

"Why should I?" I say, scowling, turning around. I expected to see one of those burly men who were wimps that beat up people to act tough.
Instead, a familiar face greeted me. 

"Calm down now girl," Rider says, letting out a light laugh, :Don't kill me please." He raised his hands in mock defeat. 

"Rider? I thought were meeting at 3? Am I late?" I asked, confused. 

"Check your phone." He says laughing. 

I turned on my phone, connecting to Rider's hotspot. What greeted me was about a hundred messages from the same person. 
"WE NEED YOU HERE NOW." 
"SEND, STUPID MESSAGE." 

The rest were basically of the same context. "Ah..." I say, realisation hitting me. Whoops. I am screwed. I should really get mobile data soon.
I looked up once I was done scrolling the messages. 

"Well, let's go."
